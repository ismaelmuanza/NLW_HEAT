Prisma + Express JS + SQLite + Node JS

About App:
  This is a Compliments App with three tables: users, tags, and compliments.
  In this app, users can send compliments to each other by selecting a tag and adding a message.
  
  The app includes:
  
  Authentication with JWT.
  Password encryption using bcrypt.
  Authorization middleware to restrict access to certain routes for admin users only.
  All of this is automated with authentication middlewares to ensure security and role-based access control.
